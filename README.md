# Machine Learning 
Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. Machine learning algorithms are used in the applications of email filtering, detection of network intruders, and computer vision, where it is infeasible to develop an algorithm of specific instructions for performing the task.
# Machine Learning Algorithms 
Machine Learning algorithm is an evolution of the regular algorithm. It makes your programs “smarter”, by allowing them to automatically learn from the data you provide. The algorithm is mainly divided into:

- Training Phase
- Testing phase
